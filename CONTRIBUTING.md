# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.
There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

Run `mvn clean verify` before making pull request and all plugins should
take care of verifying different checks and automatically formatting
code according to required code style. We will comment on fixing any
style issues that are not picked up by the formatter plugin.
